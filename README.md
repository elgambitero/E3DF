# E3DF

3D printable Electric Ducted Fan


This project aims to design an EDF that it is possible to print in a common FDM 3D printer, 
but having in mind as many fluid dynamics as possible. 

The first attempt will be empowered by the HK2627 brushless engine (the one I've got at hand),
but the files will be made so this can be changed easily to any other engine.

Everything will be designed in FreeCAD, unless impossible.

This project is currently in an early stage of development, and no functionality is to be 
expected from it right now.
